Welcome to the CodSoft Team Projects repository! This folder contains a collection of projects that I worked on during my time with the CodSoft team. Each project showcases different aspects of my skills in data analysis, tools, and problem-solving.

## Folder Structure

- **Project 1: [Credit Card Fraud Detection]**
  - **Description:** This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. The goal is to develop a robust system that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions and help prevent financial losses..
  - **Technologies Used:** Programming Languages: Python
                           Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
                           Tools: Jupyter Notebook
  - **Features:** Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
                  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and identifying patterns that distinguish fraudulent transactions.
                  Model Selection: Training various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests
